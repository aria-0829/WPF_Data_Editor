# WPF_Data_Editor
 
This project presents a WPF-based game object editor designed for a space war/adventure game. 

The editor allows users to create, edit, and delete the following game objects: 
- Space ships
- Officers
- Planetary Systems
- Missions

The editor supports online data storage and retrieval from a MongoDB database

There are some relationships between the objects, so related objects can automatically update when changes to one object are made. 

the editor incorporates relationships between the objects, ensuring that changes to one object automatically update related objects.
